   **This FAQ was written by a non-expert so may contain both fiction and fact!**

This is an unofficial list of some Transaction Family (TF) settings.
There is no central registry, most or all of these can be found found on github.

The following are some Sawtooth settings.
Since Sawtooth settings are extensible and include transaction family-specific settings, this list is incomplete.

* Some baseline settings are documented at https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0/transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family.html
* Transactor settings are documented at https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/sysadmin_guide/configuring_permissions.html
  and at https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family.html
* PoET settings are documented at https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/sysadmin_guide/configure_sgx.html
* Validator settings are documented at https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/architecture/injecting_batches_block_validation_rules.html#on-chain-validation-rules
  and https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/architecture/injecting_batches_block_validation_rules.html#on-chain-configuration
