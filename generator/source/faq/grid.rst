General Hyperledger Grid FAQ
============================

.. _faq-what-is-hyperledger-grid:

What is Hyperledger Grid?
-------------------------

Hyperledger Grid is a platform for building supply chain solutions that include
distributed ledger components. This project's goal is to speed up the development
of modular blockchain-based solutions for cross-industry supply chain problems.

Hyperledger Grid provides a set of libraries, data models, and SDKs that can be
used to develop supply chain smart contracts and client interfaces.

* `hyperledger/grid <https://github.com/hyperledger/grid>`__: Core components
  such as supply-chain-centric data types and reference implementations of
  smart contracts

* `hyperledger/grid-contrib <https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib>`__:
  Contributed code that is not yet in the core grid repository, as well as
  example domain models and reference implementations for smart contracts
  (also called "transaction families")

* `hyperledger/grid-rfcs <https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs>`__:
  RFCs (requests for comments) for proposed and approved changes to
  Hyperledger Grid

.. _faq-where-is-the-documentation:

Where is the documentation?
---------------------------

See `Docs </docs>`__ for all current Hyperledger Grid documentation.
