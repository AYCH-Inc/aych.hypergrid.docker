FAQ: Sawtooth REST API
==================

What's the difference between the ``sawtooth-rest-api --bind`` and ``--connect`` options?
-------------------

``sawtooth-rest-api --bind`` (``-B``)
    specifies where your rest-api would listen. The default is http://localhost:8008
``sawtooth-rest-api --connect`` (``-C``)
    specifies where your rest-api can reach to the validator. The default is http://localhost:4004

What REST API commands are available?
-------------------

Use localhost to access the REST API from the Validator Docker container or from where the Validator is running.
For example:

::

    curl http://localhost:8008/state
From the Client Docker container, access from rest-api.  For example:

::

    curl http://rest-api:8008/state
