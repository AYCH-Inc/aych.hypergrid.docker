* What's the difference between the sawtooth-rest-api --bind (or -B) and --connect (or -C) options?

--bind (-B) specifies where your rest-api would listen. The default is http://localhost:8008
--connect (-C) specifies where your rest-api can reach to the validator. The default is http://localhost:4004
